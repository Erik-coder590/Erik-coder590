# 👋 Hi! I'm Erik 👾

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm 13 years old and I love coding and learning new stuff.

## 🛠️ Stuff I Use
Here are some of the tools and languages I like:

- 💻 Languages: `Python`(the basics), `C`(still learning!), `C++`(my favourite!)
- 🕹️ Game Dev: `SDL2`
- 🌍 Web Stuff: `HTML`, `CSS`(a little bit)
- 🧪 Others: `Linux`(i use linux)

## 🧠 What I'm Learning Now
I’m currently learning:

- `Assembly` (it’s kinda hard but fun)
- `C`
- Machine learning like `neural networks`

## 🎮 Projects I’m Working On
Here are a few things I’ve been building:

- 🐉 A 2D snake game with SDL2 in C++
- 👾 A Pixel editor where you can edit images (with fstream) in C++;
- 🤖 A neural network from scratch (doesn't work yet!) in C++
